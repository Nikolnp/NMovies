# NMovies

I have done my best for the time given to implement the APIs as it's my first time with API building.

I have included basic:
Pagination
Filtering
Sorting and Searching functionality

Search by partial string Title
Top 5 Movies by Rating in ascending order.


Future Improvements:

Later I would see to fully implementing the APIs.
Also, using Identify Server to secure the project.

I would add frontend and CRUD operations for 
Users and Movies.
